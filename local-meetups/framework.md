We are introducing a new framework for in-person local meetups to nurture local communities. OSPO Local Meetups aim to provide a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experience on OSPOs and Open Source Management within specific regions.

### The Framework

In a nutshell, the framework defines the following local meetup requirements:

* Hybrid gatherings that are open to TODO members, OSPOlogy community and the public.
* Hosted by a Local OSPO Ambassador (see [Local Ambassador's requirements](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/local-meetups/local-ambassadors-guidelines.md#requirements-and-responsibilities))
* Follow [Chatham House Rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule)
  * Recordings are not allowed
  * The information received can be shared as meet-up notes, but does not reveal the identity of who said it
* Provides a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experience on OSPOs and Open Source Management
* Encourages neutraly
* Encourages diversity of attendees and regions to participate including hosting meetups in local languages
* Everyone can propose a new local OSPO meetup
* Is under Linux Foundation [policies](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/policies/) and [code of conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/)
* Participants must register for OSPO Local meetups via [Linux Foundation’s community platform](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group-europe/).

### Meetup Expectations

OSPO Local meetups supported by the TODO Group is committed to vendor neutrality and aims to become a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experiences on OSPOs. Even though we understand that during a conversation, OSPO tooling and/or services examples might arise, vendors may not propose solutions or use the meetups under the TODO Group umbrella for any discussions designed to generate sales for a vendor. Meetups are not intended to be vendor pitches and can’t be used for that purpose if you would like to have the meetup under the TODO Group branding.

### Local Ambassador Requirements and Responsibilities

Please read the [local ambassador guideline document](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/local-meetups/local-ambassadors-guidelines.md#requirements-and-responsibilities)

## How can I start a new OSPO Local Meetup?

If you are interested in organizing a OSPO Local Meetups in your region feel free to open a new [GH Discussion under OSPOlogy repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions), indicating the desired location and how the creation of this meetup can benefit the OSPO Community. The [TODO Steering Committee](https://github.com/todogroup/governance#-about-todo-steering-committee-tsc) will review this proposal and has the final word to approve/decline.

## How does TODO Group provide support?

The TODO Group provides a neutral and safe environment for the creation and development of these meetups, supporting the local community with the online platform, policies, framework, code of conduct, communication channels, branding, and promotion.
