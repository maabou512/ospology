# OSPO Local Ambassadors Guidelines

OSPO Local Meetups are great ways to learn about new OSPO trends, open source strategy and open source management tooling. If there's not one in your area, it's easy to start one.

This document serves as a guide for a OSPO Local Ambassador when setting up an OSPO Meetup within their region.

## Planning the OSPO Meetup

* Check if there's already an OSPO Meetup in your area
* Open a new [GH Discussion under OSPOlogy repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions), indicating the desired location and how the creation of this meetup can benefit the OSPO Community
* Wait for the TODO Program Manager to (1) open the new OSPO Local Meetup via LF Online Community Platform and (2) give you organizer permissions. If needed, you can also mirror these meetups on a third party platform, such as meetup.com
* Start promoting your event via [Linux Foundation’s Online Community platform](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/), as well as on Twitter, LinkedIn, and other local outlets.
* You can also promote on TODO Slack / Community mailing list. If needed, you can also request a groups.io mailing list for that specific local community.


## Commitment

Being promoted as OSPO Local ambassador means:

* You understand OSPO Local meetups supported by the TODO Group are committed to vendor neutrality and aim to become a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experiences on OSPO.
* You do not use an OSPO Meetup with the main goal of having discussions designed to generate sales for a vendor.
* You meet OSPO Local Ambassador's [requirements](#local-host-requirements-and-responsibilities)
* You take care of OSPO Local Ambassador's [responsibilities](#local-host-requirements-and-responsibilities)
