# Welcome to APAC OSPOlogy meetings

Monthly community APAC timezone-friendly meetings to discuss the status of OSPOs in APAC regions. Each year, the community defines the core topics and scope of work they would like to focuss during the year. APAC OSPOlogy meetings are hosted by [the OSPOlogy APAC moderators](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/meetings/Sync%20Chapters/moderator-list.md).

## Scope of work in 2023

The community has identified four main OSPO challenges to streamline open source in organizations:

* **Culture and education:** ways to bridge the gap between traditional software development practices and the requiremetns of open source development
* **Processes:** how to adapt organization's internal processs to support the dynamic open source development
* **Tools:** tech stack to support open source development model, fulfill the needs of the OSPO, and meet organization's guidelines
* **Continuity and sustainability:** How to ensure continued financial and executive support and provide adequate resources to support the open source program

By the end of 2022 OSPOlogy APAC community expresed the desire of focussing on the "Continuity & Sustanability" challenge in 2023 while coordinating efforts with the CHAOSS OSPO Metrics WG. In order to do this, we will align the discussions between CHAOSS APAC and OSPOlogy APAC calls

> The community proposal can be found in the [OSPO Forum](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions/221).
