This past year has been full of challenges and opportunities. TODO Group pursued its mission of helping Open Source Program Office adoption, 
education, and success within organizations across sectors and regions. The project launched many exciting new initiatives, refined existing ones, 
and received contributions from open source leaders and OSPO practitioners worldwide.

Hope you enjoy time with your loved ones and have a relaxed start to the new year.
