## üçø Next OSPOlogy Community Call

A place to share experiences and connect with OSPO mentors across the different sectors!

### March, 29th | OSPOs & Transition Paths for Regulated Environments

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43671777/222405348-55d43dfe-5bc8-4fbb-aaa1-6a0fb6fb7b49.png" width="360" height="200" />

In today's world, many organizations are recognizing the importance of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) in managing their open source activities. However, some highly regulated environments face unique challenges in adopting OSPOs. To bridge this gap, this panel will explore different approaches for creating a clear path towards building a sustainable OSPO, including the use of InnerSource Patterns and other best practices.

During this session, our panelists will focus on three key areas: Procurement, Internal Culture, and External Affairs. Each of these areas presents its own set of strategic considerations that can serve as transition paths to successful OSPO adoption.

Join us for a deep dive into the practical steps organizations can take to build a sustainable OSPO with transition paths. Our panelists will share their expertise and experience on each area, providing insights that can help you build an effective OSPO that meets the unique needs of your organization.
