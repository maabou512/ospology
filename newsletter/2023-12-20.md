## 💡Open Source Guide of the month

TODO Guides are developed by the community to help more organizations to implement open source management best practices and under CC-BY 4.0. The outbound open source guide is about how to contribute to or to launch an open source project (also called “outbound open source”) as a company. It aims to describe a complete and lean process, that can be implemented in companies of any size (large but also small or medium sized organizations): https://todogroup.org/resources/guides/a-guide-to-outbound-open-source-software/
