## OSPOLogy Live Mission & Strategic Goals

This document is intended to serve as a guide for OSPOlogy Live audience and organizers to have an allignment and
better understanding on the initiative's mission and goals for 2023.

From now on *we* will refer to OSPOlogyLive Organizers, that includes representatives form the following open source
projects and foundations: OpenSSF, OpenChain, TODO Group, InnerSource Commons, CHAOSS, SPDX and LF Energy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Proposal

OSPOlogy Live is a series of small-scale local conferences designed as interactive lectures and breakout rooms that aim to connect open source program office (OSPO) professionals from both local and international spheres. The events facilitate the exchange of knowledge and information on existing projects within open source communities, as well as provide a platform to discuss emerging trends and collaborate on best practices in OSPOs tailored to the specific needs of each region.

### ðŸ¤” Why OSPOlogyLive Europe?

Open Source adoption and perception has a different story across regions. In Europe for instance, 
there are several factors that can explain why the differences on adoption of free software in 
organizations in Europe.

* **Legal framework:** In several European countries, there is specific legislation on the use 
use of free software in the public sphere, which has promoted its adoption in government administrations 
and state agencies.

* **Motivators:** In general, the tech culture in Europe is more likely to value privacy and security. In other regions such as United States, the technological culture focuses 
more on innovation and the market.

* **Organizational culture:** In general, organizations in Europe tend to be conservative in adopting new technologies 
and cautious in terms of risks and investment in technology. 

* **Transition efforts:** European organizations can highly rely on proprietary software, 
and the transition to free software may require significant investment in staff training and adaptation of processes and systems. 
In addition, some proprietary software providers have adopted business strategies that hinder the adoption of free software, 
such as the use of closed formats or the lack of interoperability.

These and other factors has shaped the adoption of open source within organizations in Europe. Because of this,
we believe is important to promote the adoption of Open Source entities (called OSPOs) based on specific region needs, and 
provide a secure space where local and international OSPO practitioners and open source experts from different communities
collaborate and corss-share information to avoid duplicated efforts.

## ðŸ§© Strategic Goals for 2023

Here are the strategic goals for OSPOlogyLive in 2023, agreed upon by the OSPOlogyLive organizers:

1. **Showcase Emerging Trends and Best Practices in OSPOs from Partner Communities:** The field of OSPOs is constantly evolving, and there are always new tools, techniques, and approaches to explore. In 2023, we propose showcasing emerging trends, existing projects, and best practices in OSPOs, including topics such as security, open data, compliance, governance, and community management.

2. **Encourage More Diversity and Inclusion in OSPOlogyLive:** In 2023, we propose making diversity and inclusion a central theme of OSPOlogyLive and ensuring that the event is accessible to a wide range of regions and sectors. Because of that, diversity is repesented in the [OSPOlogyLive selection criteria](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospology-live/framework.md#how-host-selection-criteria-works) as follows:

  * We look for hosts that represent a diverse range of organization sizes, not only large but also small and medium as well as different industries to provide a well-rounded perspective on how OSPOs can be adopted to streamline open source operations.
  
  * We prioritize regions where an OSPOlogyLive event has not been organized yet and has easy access location to ensure that attendees can travel with ease.
